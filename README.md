You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.

Ridge and lasso are two types of Regularization techniques. Regularization helps to solve the
problem of overfitting. The optimal value of alpha for ridge regression is 15 and for lasso is 600. The
alpha which is the hyperparameter of the model which manages the trade-off by adjusting the
penalty. If hyperparameter is doubled model will be more complex to the cost function. Hence
higher the lambda value will bias the model.
